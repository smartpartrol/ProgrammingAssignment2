### Introduction

I was having some githubish technical difficulties so I simply changed my Rprogramming assignment to this one

This is still for the Data Cleaning Course by JHU  on Course A


The attached text will do the following :


1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
